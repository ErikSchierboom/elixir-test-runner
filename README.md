Exercism Automated Test Runner for Elixir Exercises

## Environment

The test runner currently targets exercises supporting Elixir >= 1.6 and Erlang/OTP >= 20.

## Testing

---

> It is recommended to test BEFORE submitting a PR.  It will test your submission, ensure
> that the repository builds as a whole, and help guard against unintentional, unrelated changes.
